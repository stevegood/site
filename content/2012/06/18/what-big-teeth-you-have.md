## The SteveGood.org Repository Visualized

A while back I found a [really interesting utility](http://code.google.com/p/gource/ "Gource") for visualizing the activity of a Git repository. Here's a cool little video of the repo for this site as visualized by Gource.  Enjoy!

## What Big Teeth You Have

I have been experimenting with a number of different photography techniques, one of those is [the invisible black backdrop](http://glyndewisblog.com/2010/01/19/the-invisible-black-backdrop-photography-technique/ "The Invisible Black Backdrop").  Using this technique, I decided to follow my chihuahua around and generally annoy him with my flash.  The result was a yawn captured at just the right moment.  Isn't he just so vicious?
