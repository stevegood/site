This is the finished product of the image below. It was taken in downtown Fort Worth on my last photowalk research day. I was fascinated by the combination of glass, metal and concrete and the lines they formed. Normally, this is filled with flowing water but I got there just shortly after they turned everything off. I really dig the way everything looks even without the water.

### Brackets

I saw [a post on Google+](https://plus.google.com/117080460060821588163/posts/dAsnQywY8Vq) where someone posted a collage with the brackets used to make up one of their HDRs.  I thought this was pretty cool and decided to do one of my own using [Diptic](http://dipticapp.com/) for Mac. What do ya' think?
