## Chromatic Aberrations

The last round of photos that I processed really gave me an opportunity to hone my skill at removing chromatic aberrations, those pesky purple lines that plague so many digital photos. Thanks to a technique I saw on YouTube (below) I was able to take care of them without degrading the quality of the photo.

## Secrets

Another photo taken at the Fort Worth Water Gardens. This was taken at the Quiet Pool just before sunset. I was really struck by how calm this space was, I almost felt out of place with my big tripod and camera.
