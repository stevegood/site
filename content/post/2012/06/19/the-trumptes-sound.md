Here is another shot I snapped while exploring Fort Worth and gathering info for my fall photowalk. This is on the side of Bass Performance Hall.  The building and the angel are carved out of Texas limestone, which was quarried near Austin. You can [read more about these amazing sculptures on Google Books](http://books.google.com/books/about/Angels_on_high.html?id=oWhQAAAAMAAJ "Angels on high: Márton Váró's limestone angels on the Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas").
