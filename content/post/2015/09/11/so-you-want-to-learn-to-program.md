I get asked all the time [on my stream](http://twitch.tv/ExtremeModeration/) which language someone should learn when they first get started. I typically start by asking what the end goal is. Want to build games? Websites? Desktop applications? The answer to that question will lead new developers in totally different directions.  I recently found a pretty good [infographic](http://carlcheo.com/startcoding) to help young developers choose a language that best suites their goals.
